# Gait-Recognition
The primary advantage of walking pattern recognition over other biometrics is that it doesn't require subjects to cooperate. This characteristic makes it a fascinating biometric modality for identifying people based on their unique walking style.

The thesis proposes a technique that uses only a single image for latency-free gait recognition. It introduces a phase estimation network for the single input image, with a gait cycle reconstruction network utilizing the estimated phase. This approach aims to reduce dependence on the encoded feature of the single image's phase.

Gait motion variances can be caused by a variety of factors, including the walking surface, carrying goods, the passage of time, walking pace, whether the walking is indoors versus outdoors, and the type of footwear or clothing worn by the individual. These factors add significant difficulty to gait identification algorithms.
